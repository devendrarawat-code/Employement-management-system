    "name": "John Doe",

Security Note ⚠️

Passwords are stored in local storage (plain text or hashed, depending on implementation). For production, use a backend with secure authentication (e.g., JWT, bcrypt). 🔒
Local storage is client-side and vulnerable to scripts, so this system is ideal for demo purposes. 🚧
